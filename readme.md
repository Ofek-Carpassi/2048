# 2048 Game
This is a very simple implementation of the classic "2048" game. <br>
It is written in JavaScript and uses the HTML5 canvas for rendering. <br>

## How to Play
The game is played on a board of a customizable size. <br>
The goal is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048. <br>
You can move the tiles up, down, left, or right using the arrow keys. <br>
When you move the tiles, they will slide in the direction you chose. <br>
If two tiles with the same number collide, they will merge into a single tile with the sum of the two numbers. <br>
After each move, a new tile with the number 2 or 4 will appear on the board. <br>
The game ends when there are no legal moves left. <br>

## Features
